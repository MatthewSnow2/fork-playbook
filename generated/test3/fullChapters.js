        "title": "Amazon EC2 Fundamentals",
        "content": "### Amazon EC2 Fundamentals\n\n**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud, serving as the foundation for most AWS workloads. Think of EC2 as renting computers in Amazon's data centers that you can configure and manage remotely.\n\n#### Key Components\n\n**Instance Types** determine your virtual machine's specifications:\n- **t3.micro**: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM - Perfect for testing and low-traffic websites\n- **m5.large**: 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM - Balanced for general applications\n- **c5.xlarge**: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM - Optimized for CPU-intensive tasks\n\n**Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)** are pre-configured templates containing:\n- Operating system (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows)\n- Software packages and configurations\n- Security settings\n\n🎓 **Example**: Launching a web server using Amazon Linux AMI with Apache pre-installed saves hours of manual setup.\n\n#### Basic Operations\n\n**Launching an Instance**:\n1. Choose AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2)\n2. Select instance type (t3.micro for testing)\n3. Configure security groups (allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic)\n4. Create or select key pair for SSH access\n\n**Managing Instances**:\n- **Start/Stop**: Control running state without losing data\n- **Terminate**: Permanently delete instance and associated storage\n- **Reboot**: Restart without data loss\n\n💡 **Cost Optimization**: Stop instances when not needed - you only pay for storage, not compute time.\n\n#### Practical Example\n\nLaunching a WordPress blog:\n```bash\n# Connect to your EC2 instance\nssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip\n\n# Install web server\nsudo yum update -y\nsudo yum install -y httpd\nsudo systemctl start httpd\n```\n\n⚠️ **Security Note**: Always use security groups to restrict access. Only open necessary ports (80 for web traffic, 22 for SSH from your IP).\n\nEC2 instances form the compute backbone that will connect to storage (S3) and networking (VPC) services we'll explore next."

        "title": "Amazon S3 Storage",
        "content": "### Amazon S3 Storage\n\n**Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** provides unlimited object storage accessible from anywhere on the internet. Unlike traditional file systems, S3 stores files as objects in containers called buckets.\n\n#### Core Concepts\n\n**Buckets** are containers with globally unique names:\n- `my-company-website-assets`\n- `user-profile-photos-2024`\n- `application-backups-prod`\n\n**Objects** are files stored with metadata:\n- Maximum size: 5TB per object\n- Unlimited storage per bucket\n- Each object has a unique key (filename/path)\n\n#### Storage Classes\n\n| Class | Use Case | Cost | Retrieval |\n|-------|----------|------|-----------|\n| **Standard** | Frequently accessed data | Higher | Instant |\n| **IA (Infrequent Access)** | Monthly backups | Medium | Instant |\n| **Glacier** | Long-term archives | Lower | Minutes-hours |\n| **Deep Archive** | Compliance data | Lowest | 12+ hours |\n\n🎓 **Example**: Store website images in Standard, monthly backups in IA, and compliance documents in Glacier.\n\n#### Common Use Cases\n\n**Web Application Storage**:\n```bash\n# Upload user profile photo\naws s3 cp profile.jpg s3://my-app-user-photos/user123/\n\n# Make publicly accessible\naws s3api put-object-acl --bucket my-app-user-photos --key user123/profile.jpg --acl public-read\n```\n\n**Static Website Hosting**:\n- Enable static website hosting on bucket\n- Upload HTML, CSS, JavaScript files\n- Access via: `http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`\n\n**Data Backup and Archival**:\n- Automatic lifecycle policies move old data to cheaper storage\n- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery\n\n💡 **Integration Example**: Your EC2 web server stores user uploads in S3, keeping compute and storage separate for better scalability.\n\n✅ **Best Practices**:\n- Enable versioning for important data\n- Use bucket policies for access control\n- Set up lifecycle rules to optimize costs\n- Enable server-side encryption for sensitive data\n\n🔧 **Real Scenario**: An e-commerce site stores product images in S3 Standard, uses CloudFront CDN for global delivery, and archives old transaction logs to Glacier after 1 year."

        "title": "AWS Lambda Serverless",
        "content": "### AWS Lambda Serverless\n\n**AWS Lambda** runs your code without managing servers. You upload functions that execute in response to events, paying only for actual execution time - perfect for event-driven applications and microservices.\n\n#### How Lambda Works\n\n**Function Execution Model**:\n1. Event triggers function (API call, file upload, scheduled time)\n2. AWS provisions compute resources automatically\n3. Your code executes (maximum 15 minutes)\n4. Resources are released, billing stops\n\n**Supported Languages**: Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PowerShell\n\n#### Common Triggers\n\n**API Gateway**: HTTP requests trigger functions\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    # Process API request\n    name = event['queryStringParameters']['name']\n    return {\n        'statusCode': 200,\n        'body': json.dumps(f'Hello {name}!')\n    }\n```\n\n**S3 Events**: Process files when uploaded\n```python\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    # Triggered when file uploaded to S3\n    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']\n    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']\n    \n    # Process image, generate thumbnail\n    print(f'Processing {key} from {bucket}')\n```\n\n**CloudWatch Events**: Scheduled execution\n- Run daily reports at 6 AM\n- Clean up temporary files hourly\n- Send weekly summary emails\n\n#### Practical Examples\n\n**Image Processing Pipeline**:\n1. User uploads photo to S3 bucket\n2. S3 triggers Lambda function\n3. Lambda resizes image, creates thumbnail\n4. Processed images stored back in S3\n\n**API Backend**:\n```python\n# Simple user registration API\ndef register_user(event, context):\n    user_data = json.loads(event['body'])\n    \n    # Validate email\n    # Store in database\n    # Send welcome email\n    \n    return {\n        'statusCode': 201,\n        'body': json.dumps({'message': 'User registered successfully'})\n    }\n```\n\n💡 **Cost Benefits**: A function running 100ms, 1000 times daily costs ~$0.0002/day vs. ~$26/month for smallest EC2 instance.\n\n🔧 **Integration**: Lambda functions can read from S3 buckets, write to databases, and respond to API calls - creating serverless architectures that scale automatically.\n\n⚠️ **Limitations**: 15-minute maximum execution, cold start delays, stateless execution model."
